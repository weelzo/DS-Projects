## Summary of Findings

> My analysis focused on relations between (user type, number of trips, and duration), I found a big relation between the number of trips and user type which is the subscribers usually bikes in going to work, the heat above maps illustrates the time of using biked for subscribers in morning and afternoon. Customers usually use bikes for casual walks.
Also, the relation between user type and duration it from the plots above it seems customers take more time with the bike in their casual walk than subscribers in using a bike for going to work
